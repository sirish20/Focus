# FOCUS (Chrome Extension)

## Overview

The **Focus** Mode Chrome extension is designed to enhance your YouTube viewing experience by minimizing distractions and improving productivity. Whether you're watching a tutorial while coding or just want to enjoy a video without clutter, this extension is here to help.

## YouTube Video Link

   ```

## Features

- **Distraction-Free Viewing**: Automatically hides all screen elements except the video player by applying a dark overlay around the video. This ensures you can fully focus on the content without getting distracted by recommendations, comments, or ads.
- **Auto-Pause on Tab Switch**: The extension pauses the video whenever you switch tabs, ensuring you donâ€™t miss any part of your video. Playback resumes automatically when you return to the YouTube tab.
- **YouTube & VS Code Integration**: For those who like to code along with tutorials, this feature allows you to minimize the YouTube video to a small screen in the corner by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + Z. This lets you follow along with the video while working in VS Code simultaneously.
